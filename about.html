I'm passionate about coding because I want to build beautiful web sites and apps that enhance lives, strengthen businesses and energize communities.

But this wasn't always the case.

Growing up, I taught myself BASIC in elementary school and built some web sites (with more tables than you could shake a stick at!) in high school.  But in college I fell in love with Lady Philosophy and found myself spending far more time with ancient books than the latest technology.  

I then pursued idealistic ventures such as teaching prisoners and inter-religious dialogue.  These things were fulfilling, but don't pay enough to raise a family on.

Therefore like most humanities majors, I ended up in that island of lost souls known as Law School.

Believe it or not, I actually had a lot of fun with the demanding test I had to take to get admittance, and enjoyed the cut and thrust of the "Socratic" classroom.  But playing logic games and being a lawyer re two very different things, and I was rapidly coming to realize I didn't want to be a lawyer.  I wanted to make things, not litigate things.

Fortunately, there is a career that could be described as "playing with logic in order to make cool things."  That was computer programming, which I took up again first as a hobby and then as a calling.  

Looking for the fastest way to take my amateur skills to the professional level I enrolled in Lambda school and the rest is history.

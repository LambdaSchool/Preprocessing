  <h2>the next step on my journey</h2>
  <p>
    it was finally time to turn over a new leaf and next thing i knew i realized a life long dream
    of mine. i opened a home home designer branch of my very own. now not only was i able to sell
    affordable, custom homes and goods. i was able to help others with a dream themed room or rooms
    of their very own. i hired some people to help me out. and now i fully intend to
    keep on dreaming.

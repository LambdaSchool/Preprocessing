                    <p>Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world. Duffman can't breathe! OH NO!

                    I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! </p><div class="button-div"><button>Fire Me!</button></div>

                    <p>thank you, steal again. Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark. D'oh. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try.

Homer no function beer well without. Dad didn't leaveâ€¦ When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face! Donuts. Is there anything they can't do? You don't like your job, you don't strike. You go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way.</p>

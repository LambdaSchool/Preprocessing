      <h1>About Myself</h1>
      <p>Thank you for viewing my resume. My name is Alphonse Sharkton, I was born
        in the Indian Ocean, but grew up in New York. I have many years experience as a guard shark,
        working for notable companies such as, Amazon, Enron, Evil Inc., and CNN. As an industry proffesional I constantly keep myself up-to-date with best practices and procedures.
        I will bring the best quality performance to your organization. I excel at scaring off corporate rivals, governemnt agents, medling heros and much more. 
        Once I find a problem I sink my teeth into it and dont let go until the task is finished, anything my teeth can't solve can be easily taken care of with my laser.

      <h1>About My Laser</h1>
      <p>The real reason you're here is because you want to know more about the laser. 
      It's a 60kW-class fiber laser, mounted to my head by an exceptionally thin polyacrilonitrile nanofiber, a type of synthetic polymer related to acrylic, using a technique called electrospinning.
      The weapon itself is a beam-combined fiber laser, meaning different laser modules are fired up and combined using a fiber optic cable into a single light source. 
      It's near diffraction-limited, allowing my shots to be tightly focused over long distances, and has applications in land sea, or air, anything that can outswim me, assuredly cannot outswim my laser.

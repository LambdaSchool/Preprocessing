        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As a kid, I was fascinated by technology and gaming. 
          The schools in my neighborhood offered classes like "computers" where you would play educational games and learn coding basics; however, I didn't realize how both could play together until my father purchased my first gaming system: The Nintendo 64.
          I would play games like Mortal Combat, Tomb Raider, PacMan, Mario Kart and Zelda just to name a few.
          As I grew older, my technology upgraded. At the age of 11, my mom purchased my first computer! 
          As a teenager, I would spend hours on my Hewlett Packard building Myspace page templates, and Neopet shopping pages.
          My passion for coding took a backseat as an adult to odd jobs and trying to make ends meet but now I am fully pursuing my passion and giving tech my all.

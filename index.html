    <h3>Hey. Stay alert out there.</h3>
    <p>"Cayde is a cunning hunter, with years of experience in staying alive in the wilds. <br> But, um, fighting a war isn't his strong suit. <br> I'm not sure the 'shoot them all to death' strategy is going to be enough." -Ghost</p>

    <h2>Hey There...</h2>
    <p>Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.</p>

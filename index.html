            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>
              Hi, my name is Anisha and I am a medical student turned software developer, 
              I am currently studying at Lambda School. I aim to enter the product management 
              space in the near future by pairing my unique background in medicine with my 
              technical acumen, eye for design, and strong interpersonal and communication skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              I hope to foster collaboration and ingenuity among a multidisciplinary team, with 
              the shared goal of shipping products that provide users with immense utility while 
              implementing human-centered design. My love for technology, design, and creation, 
              coupled with my penchant for understanding people and identifying what makes them 
              tick, drives me.

          <h2>Work History</h2>
          <p>
            Since graduating high school, I have chosen to focus on my education and as such, 
            was continually enrolled in school - college, then graduate school, and now Lambda 
            School. During that time, however, I have worked in part-time roles which have 
            included being a TA for multiple biology courses in college, a Mock Trial Coach, 
            Research Assistant at Drexel University, and as an instructor and private tutor in 
            Biology, Chemistry, Writing, and Mathematics at Mathnasium and Elite Prep.

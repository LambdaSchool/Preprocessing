        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am a student Web Developer currently attending Lambda School. I have always been interested in web development
          and technology in general for as long as I can remember. I have always had a passion for building things and making
          sure whatever it is I build is of great quality. I have a background in electrical construction, this has taught
          me how to think critically and how to problem solve effectively. These skills have translated incredibly well into
          programming.

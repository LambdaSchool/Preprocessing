      <h1>About Me: Clark Kent</h1>
      <p>I'm just a simple country boy from Smallville looking for a steady job to help cover payments on my family's farm.
        I'm an ordinary, hard-working <span class="cross">Superman</span> who has faith that everything will work out in
        the end if you just <span class="cross">have god-tier superpowers</span> put in the work.</p>

      <h2>Job History</h2>
      <p>I've worked at the Daily Planet for like, all my adult life. Straight out of highschool. Yeah it's been my only
        job, but I'm very good at working as part of a team, even if I have to carry everybody's dead weight... wait that
        picture shouldn't be there either. It should just be me and Lois having coffee, I swear. Did Flash do this?</p>

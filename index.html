        <h3>Listen Up...</h3>
        <p>There was a war. A Time War. The Last Great Time War. My people fought a race called the Daleks, for the sake of all creation. And they lost. We lost. Everyone lost. They're all gone now. My family. My friends. Even that sky. It is! It's the city of New New York! Strictly speaking, it's the fifteenth New York since the original, so that makes it New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New-New New York. Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice. I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you?</p>

        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <p>I am the official ruler of Quadling County in the northern quadrant of Oz.  
          I have ruled over and protected this county ever since the overthrow of the Wicked Witch of the South.
          I live in a palace near the southern border of the Quadling Country, attended by fifty beautiful maidens from each country of Oz.
          I am strongly protective of her subjects in the South. I have created a walled, gated communities for the rabbits of Bunnybury and the paper dolls of Miss Cuttenclip, showing a personal interest in the concerns of not only the humanoid Quadlings, but also the other inhabitants of my jurisdiction.
         I am experienced and seasoned to the point of knowing that there is not a magic cure for everything, and that certain things cannot be changed or perhaps should not be changed for better or for worse.

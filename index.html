          <p>I have endured a great deal of ridicule without much malice; and have received a great deal of kindness, not quite free from ridicule. I am used to it. Folks are usually about as happy as they make their minds up to be. Folks are usually about as happy as they make their minds up to be. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved -- I do not expect the house to fall -- but I do expect it will cease to be divided.</p><br>

          <p>Common looking people are the best in the world: that is the reason the Lord makes so many of them. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. First, that no negro slave, imported as such from Africa, and no descendant of such slave can ever be a citizen of any State, in the sense of that term as used in the Constitution of the United States. Those who deny freedom to others, deserve it not for themselves; and, under a just God, can not long retain it.</p>

    <h2>INTRO</h2>
    <p>The reason that I would be a good hire is that I put my all into getting what I want. I put days and days of training to acquire this unique skill that no other person has. My ability to take down any enemy with just one punch alone, should get me on your team. </p>

      <h2>SKILLS</h2>
      <p>The best thing about me is that I haven't needed any other skill other than my sheer strength to get through anything. Why do you think there's a show about me?</p>

      <h2>WORK HISTORY</h2>
      <p>You know, I never really had a job. All I've done to get me to now is defeat bad guys. I got bored of that so I decided to get a job, to keep me busy at least. Then I'll get bored of this and I'll move onto the next thing.</p>

      <h2>CONTACT</h2>
      <p>If you need me, you're either in trouble and you can scream for my help. Or your interested in something of mine, in that case don't bother trying to contact me. In any other case you can drop your info below and I might get to it.</p>

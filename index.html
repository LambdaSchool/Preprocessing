The same goes for my place of work. I've been able to make some amazing improvements to the places I've worked. Here's a link to some of the work I've done.</p>

    <h3>Back Story</h3>
    <p>I was born in a rural village outside of Memphis, TN. A place called Hard Work. A tight knit community of people from all over the world. I was introduced to many different cultures. For a village we had some of the best schooling around. I wasn't able to appreciate it at the time but as I went out into the world the more I understand how good we have it there. I want to share what we have ot offer this is what led me to web development.</p>

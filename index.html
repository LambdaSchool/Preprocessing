                <h1>Listen up...</h1>
            <p>I just moved to Tiburon, CA in May. I am a full time student at Lambda school in San Francisco and I am also working part at a restaurant. Just within a short amount of time living here, I have gained so much knowledge and learned many new skills. One thing that sticks out the most is photography. I never tried to be a photographer before, but recently I have been blessed with the opportunity to pick up a camera and try it out. Now it is something I love and I consider it a hobby of mine. My goal is to always work hard at everything I do and to keep learning more.</p>

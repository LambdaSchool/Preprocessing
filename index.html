          <h2>What I am looking for...</h2>
          <p>My dream is to be in a company where the community is very friendly and treat each other as family. A place where I can feel I have much in common with others to get along while living life as a coder developing websites and showcase my skills as a Full Stack Web Developer. Also, looking for a place where I am challenged all the time with something new to keep my mind fresh and ready to learn what I need to tackle the problem with full force. I am not a quitter, regardless of the difficulty of a problem, I will persevere until I come to a resolution and get the desired results. This is <span>'What I am Looking For!'</span></p>

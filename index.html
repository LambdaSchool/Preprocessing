      <section id="about-me">
        <p>I was born in Tampa, Florida and since I was in college I started to gain a lot of interest in computers
        and how were they programmed. I started programming by learning how to make videogames. For a few videogames
        I made pixel art and it was an amazing rewarding experience. Later along college I started to build websites
        and got really into JavaScript. That led me to do a a few websites for some clients and a voice assistant
        for LuvCheck as an internship. I believe that every person has the potential to do great things.</p>

      <h3>Who I Am</h3>
      <p>When his parents abdicated responsibility for his upbringing at the age of three, Paul DeYonghe was taken in and raised by penguins in the poorer parts of the Tulsa metroplex. When faced as an adult with crushing pressure to contribute to society, Paul felt it his duty to learn everything he could about computers and how they work.  Nowadays, he spends the bulk of his time remedying computer issues and talking about himself in the third person.</p>

						<h2 class="intro__h2">Introduction</h2>
						<p class="intro__p">
							Welcome, my name is Chaya Otikor, 
							and I am a political science postgraduate
							breaking into the web development world.
							I love to learn new things, 
							and have found that programming fulfills my need to keep a sharp mind and inquisitive spirit in my personal and professional life.
							Prior to embarking on my programming journey, I spent two and a half years working as an administrative assistant.
							I found that administrative roles did not quite satisfy my natural curiousity. However, those roles did teach me important professional skills 
							that have helped me while learning to program such as
							time management and planning, team communication and organization, as well as problem solving and creativity. 
							Although, I am open to any experience or opportunity to build on my skills,
							I would eventually like to work on civtech and govtech projects or in the cybersecurity field.
							There is an ever increasing need for tech to help solve problems like government transparency,
							democratic consensus building, and antiquated processes that slow down civic life and engagement.
							Please feel free to reach out to me through phone or email, and thank you for visiting my page.
						</p>

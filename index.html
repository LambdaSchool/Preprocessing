        <h2>Fun Fact <br><br> </h2>
        <p>
Jobs's design aesthetic was influenced by philosophies of Zen and Buddhism. In India, he experienced Buddhism while on his seven-month spiritual journey,[176] and his sense of intuition was influenced by the spiritual people with whom he studied.[176] He also learned from many references and sources, such as modernist architectural style of Joseph Eichler,[citation needed] and the industrial designs of Richard Sapper[177] and Dieter Rams.

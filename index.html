            <h1>Hi, I'm Clint Kunz</h1><br>
            <p>Full-time Computer Science Student at Lambda School</p><br>
            <p>Four months ago, while working as a buyer, the desire came to me to become a software engineer. That desire was based in the perception that software engineers make incredible products, and they are treated well by their employers. I soon found out that there were three options to become a software engineer. 1) go back to university and get a traditional CS degree 2) attend a bootcamp for several months or 3) teach myself through online course. I was not about to spend three years at another university, and I did not want to waste time trying to teach myself, so a bootcamp became my choice. After reading reviews, interviewing admission personnel, and messaging graduates, I stumbled across Lambda School. A revolutionary school that lives up to its hype.</p>

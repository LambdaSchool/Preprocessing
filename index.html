            <h2>Curious?...</h2>
            <p>Me too. I love getting to know new people and companies in the
            industry. I enjoy diving into really challenging, but never impoosible, 
            projects. I am available for freelance, remote work, or part-time onsite 
            work. Traveling is one of my favorite things, so I am definitely open to 
            such an opportunity. I am a highly independent, motivated, creative, dedicated
            and driven individual. I also play well with others. So don't be shy. If you think 
            I would be a good fit for a team or project you are working on, feel free to contact me.
            Let's build something amazing and have a ton of fun in the process.</p>

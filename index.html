      <h2>Background:</h2>

      <p>I have conceived, developed, and launched a video sharing reading product, designed to bring families together. 
        I searched, interviewed, and built a team who possessed the skills to bring my vision to reality. I was able to 
        cold call and close licensing deals with domestic and international publishers. As part of our go to market strategy, 
        I contacted local and national media to get free publicity. I also created strategic partnerships with organizations: SAG, MLBPAA (MLB alumni association), 
        UPenn, and Folds of Honor.</p>

      <h2>Intro!</h2>
      <p>For the past few months I've developed my programming skills with the help of Lambda School and its amazing team. This allows me to apply not only my marketing background to a product, but how to display it for a wide range of consumers online in a fashionable and appealing way. While I am new to coding I always bring a positive attitude while trying to solve complex problems with a team of professionals all working towards the same goal.</p>

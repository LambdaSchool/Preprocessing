                  <h3>Worked Here</h3>
                  <h4>Millennium Falcon</h4>
                  <p>They aren't here! Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured. Hurry! One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner! Get on top of it! I'm trying! Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where could they be? Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off! Are you there, sir? Threepio! We've had some problems... Will you shut up and listen to me? Shut down all garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy? Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level. No. Shut them all down! Hurry! Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master! Threepio, we're all right! We're all right. You did great.</p>

                  <h3>Worked There</h3>
                  <h4>X-Wing Fighter</h4>
                  <p>How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life. I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier. What makes you think there are settlements over there? Don't get technical with me. What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile! And don't let me catch you following me begging for help, because you won't get it. No more adventures. I'm not going that way.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h3>Worked Everywhere</h3>
                  <h4>On C-3PO</h4>
                  <p>Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year. You mean the next semester before harvest? Sure, there're more than enough droids. Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year. You must understand I need you here, Luke. But it's a whole 'nother year. Look, it's only one more season. Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left. Where are you going? It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids.</p>

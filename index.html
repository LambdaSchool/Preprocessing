        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I was once called the Queen of Clouds while managing a vape shop.  I entered a very controversial field during a time of new regulation. Not only did I have to keep up to date on new products and technology coming out but I also had to keep up with the regulation and following the current laws.  There were things I could not touch nor talk about with out the risk of a fine. I aided in creating new ways to explain and assist my customers in new products while still following the federal and state regulations.
            This determination and passion I learned can and will be brought forth in my web development career.  Without learning and growth there is no success.

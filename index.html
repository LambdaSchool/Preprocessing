    About Me
    Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others.

    Hobbies
    Ripping. I can get a large stuffy empty in less than 20 minutes. 
    Walking. I like my 1-2 mile walks twice per day please. Preferably when it's cool.
    Lounging. My nap time is usually 11 am to 7 pm. Do Not Disturb.
    Licking. Your face. Your hands. My butt. Never in that order.

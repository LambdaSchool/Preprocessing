        <h1>About Myself</h1>
        <p>
            Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla received an advanced 
            education in engineering and physics in the 1870s and gained practical 
            experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental 
            Edison in the new electric power industry. He emigrated to the United 
            States in 1884, where he would become a naturalized citizen. He worked 
            for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he 
            struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market 
            his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to 
            develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices.

        <h2>Introductions</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently searching for an opportunity to work in either a small-scale or large-scale company. I have worked in both types of environments, with the most recent being a C-series funded tech startup. I have gained experience as business operations lead, in customer success and wellness, maintaining B2B partnerships, warehouse operations management, and an all-around knack for technical sophistication.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I am also currently attending an online school through a fast paced 1 year (part-time) full-stack web developer program at Lambda School. I expect to graduate in December 2019 and have already acquired knowledge of front-end / back-end languages, and team scaled projects.

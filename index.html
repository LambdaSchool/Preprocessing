      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Initially I applied to Medical school out of college and was accepted but I was also offered a great position at a Tech firm to lead their business development team and grow it. I took the position because it made sense at the time, and since than I have been in the technology field working as a business developer first, now project manager, and hopefully soon as a web developer</p>

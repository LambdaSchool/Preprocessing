        <h2>Important Announcement</h2>
        <p>
          Hey my friend
          It seems your eyes are troubled
          Care to share your time with me
          Would you say you're feeling low and so
          A good idea would be to get it off your mind

          See you and me
          Have a better time than most can dream
          Have it better than the best
          So we can pull on through
          Whatever tears at us
          Whatever holds us down
          And if nothing can be done
          We'll make the best of what's around

          Turns out not where but who you're with
          That really matters
          And hurts not much when you're around
          And if you hold on tight
          To what you think is your thing
          You may find you're missing all the rest

          Well she ran up into the light surprised
          Her arms are open
          Her mind's eye is

          Seeing things from a
          Better side than most can dream
          On a clearer road I feel
          Oh you could say she's safe
          Whatever tears at her
          Whatever holds her down
          And if nothing can be done
          She'll make the best of what's around

          Turns out not where but what you think
          That really matters
          We'll make the best of what's around
        </p>

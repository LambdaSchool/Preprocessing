                    Discerning, intelligent, and widely respected,
                    Erwin is an able commander. While he cares deeply for his men,
                    he does not hesitate to sacrifice them for the good and prosperity of mankind,

                    kilo build
                    although some may be surprised that he is not taller considering the way he holds himself.
                    Although possessing a heavier build the weight is muscle and he is very agile and light on his feet.
                    He wears his blonde hair in a 80/20 part split with a practical undercut</p>

                    cheekbones.
                    His eyebrows are however his most obvious facial feature due to their large size an peculiar
                    shape. </p>

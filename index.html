        <p>My love for the creative arts lead me into the exciting world of coding <br> First I was driven by share curiosity, and then as I gained more knowledge as to how it all works the passion followed.</p>
           <p>Now it is a labor of love, to exciting obssesion, staying up late trying to figure things out and getting up early to squeeze in more hours before the day jams into the next project.</p>
           <p>My early educational experience was as an electronic technician dealing mostly with hardware, but was always dreaming of being a software engineer someday.</p>

      <h2>Skill-Aquisition</h2>
      <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

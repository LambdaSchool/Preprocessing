  <div>
  <p> My name is Christopher Rivera.  I started my coding journey about a year ago by starting to self teach myself.  I hen enrolled into Lambda School
    in order to fully enhance my skills for the work force.  The past few years I have been in the health field as a Recovery Specialist, and a Certified Nursing Assisstant. But I needed a change.
    I needed something more.  I took a credited Java class and fell in love from System.out.println("Hello World!");.  I am excited with all I have learned and am excited to learn as much as possible.
    My career goals are to help people by creating apps or websites to change their lives.  I am extremely motivated and a fast learner.  </p>

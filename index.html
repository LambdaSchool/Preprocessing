        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> I’m a very motivated worker and a fast learner and although I’m new to the world of tech in general, I’m not new to customer service. I noticed in your job posting that a big part of this position is interacting with customers. During my time working as a volunteer tour guide at the Zoo during the summer, I realized just how much I enjoyed helping people out and ensuring that our visitors were not only well taken care of, but that their experience was a positive one. I’m excited by the prospect of bringing this same level of commitment and enthusiasm to this new and exciting opportunity and I think this position is a great fit for me.</p>

          Defining Characteristics 
        </h2>
   
      <p class="pintro">I will cover a few reasons that consideration of my position is invaluable to prospective hiring agents and companies. <br> <br> Firstly my work ethic is demonstrated in my years of educational enrollment while working beyond full time. Not one day where my attendance came into question during my tenure at work or college.
      <br> <br> Secondly, I have demonstrated in my years of employment my ability to create ownership of my position and to find ways to improve upon the performance and productivity of said position.
    <br> <br>  Thirdly, while this ties into the second it bears its own mention. I have received awards in my educational and work background through a demonstration of perserverence, adaption to change, and managing my staff in a way they too see the value in implementing these qualities.</p>

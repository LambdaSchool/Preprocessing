    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>I was born in Raleigh, North Carolina to a teacher and a chemist, shortly after which I was educated at a Montessori school until the 7th grade. I pursued Fine Art in college and graduated in 2012 with a BFA. I concentrated in Printmaking, so without access to a shop I was unable to continue practicing. A few years after graduating a friend from college introduced me to Software Engineering.</p>

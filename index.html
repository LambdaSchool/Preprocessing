        <h4>Sofas and Cheers</h4>
        <p>At Sofas and Cheers, I worked as a Strategic Advisor and Marketing Manager. I was responsible for creating Marketing efforts, initialize planning, organize campaign reports and analyze results. I was also heavily involved in strategizing on future steps in order to grow the company. With my direction, we managed to grow our sales 50% organically and expand into two retail locations.   </p>

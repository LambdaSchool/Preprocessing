      Wait- who is Edd Burke?
    </h2>

    <p class="about__text">
      Edd Burke is the guy who helped you make that website that one time- remember? When you were trying to figure out how to put the <span class="about__text--italic">Mission: Impossible</span> theme song MIDI file in the background? When your dad was asking you about scanning those pictures from his high school graduation party to upload onto OKCupid? When your grandmother called me at, like, 5:30 in the morning to tell me that "cup holder" on her computer wasn't working anymore? Now I have a website and need a job. Do you have a job? Can I have that job?

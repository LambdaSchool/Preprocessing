    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a full stack web development student at Lambda School. I have only been attending for nearly two weeks, and I am quite excited to see where this takes me. Several months ago, I was scrolling through my Facebook feed and I saw an advertisement for Lambda School. I've never been sure of what I wanted to do at that point in my life, so I clicked the button for more information. I filled out my appliation and started my precourse work. I knew it would be a hard adventure to go on, but I figured why not? As I started getting further into my precourse work, I realized that coding is such a fun thing. I started becoming more and more in love with it. This is the journey I want to have for my future. I'm excited to see what it holds for me.

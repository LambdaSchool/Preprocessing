          <h2 id="about">Some Background Info:</h2>
          <p>I am currently 23. At 18, I started my work history through a temporary hiring agency working for a temporary agency. There, my position was called JIT clerk and I was responsible for keeping track of inventory in my designated area through a special inventory program. The job was very intuitive for me and I got the hang of things pretty fast, already having a background with playing around on computers. Unfortunatley my assignment ended a few months into working there and so it was onto the next job. I would't find another job where things felt quite as natural until the late months of my 19th year. I started working for U.S. Corrugated. Here, I started out doing a lot of labour, but as more responsibilty was set upon me, I had to learn the ins and outs to program the machine. Although I felt this job was intuitive as well, I was driving at least 2 1/2 hours of commute each day + 12 hour shifts. It took a toll on me and after falling asleep behind the wheel 2 times, I figured my life is worth a more than the job. And so I found myself messing around, looking for answers and stumbling upon an old forgotten friend. CODING! Going to school for computer science had always been something I wanted do. I even went to 3 campuses to check out their programs but never signed up. The problem wasn't with the programs themselves, but rather the time it took and the loan I would have to carry as a burden for years if things did't work out. I would say the old phrase "Stuck between a rock and a hard place" could describe my (most people's) situation. Then came Lambda, the first orginization I have come across that gave me the opportunity to say I can afford school.</p>

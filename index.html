          <h2>Value</h2>
          <p> I have a history of taking on and delivering on multiple projects at once. My ability to time-manage appropriately has allowed me to deliver outputs at 4x my peers productivty levels. I have been trusted as many as 7 projects while helping other team members who were assigned only 2. I never leave a team member behind and love having the opportunity to coach and help new developers. At the end of the day when you need someone that knows how to buckle down and deliver when deadlines are near, I wil be at the top of your list to make your problems go disappear</p>

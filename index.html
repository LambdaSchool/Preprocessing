      <p>
        I've been an artist since I was a child, I began singing in talent shows, started bands, solo projects, and amassed hundreds of thousands of plays. I took my interest in music and started applying that creative energy to audio engineering which I feel comfortable comparing myself with world class studios whom I've had the opportunities to work with - I'm highly competitive by nature, I always strive to be the absolute best I can be at any new skill and I believe my creative side influences the technical realm of my abilities in a very interesting way. Everything I do seems to be a little different from the next person, and that's what sets me apart. I'm not afraid to be different or try something new, and I don't give up easily, I have had massive wins and massive losses in my life and always bounce back with 100% of the same energy I had before.

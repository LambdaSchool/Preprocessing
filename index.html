        <h2>A few things about me...</h2>
        <p>Since I was little I remember always being around and messing with computers. I started my journey by getting my Comptia A+ Certification and completeing the Information Technology and Computer Systems program offered at Lorenzo Walker Technical College. The skills and knowleged I gaind helped get me get my first job in tech, fixing computers, which was fun, but I wanted to incorporate my creativity in my work, that is when I turned to development and haven't looked back. I completly submerged myself in online bootcamp courses learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and the list goes on... I am learning and growing my skills everyday, and strive to build projects that please myself and my clients. Please get in conact with me if you have ant other questions or are interested in working with me!</p>

<h2> Introduction</h2>
<section>
  <p>My name is Dr. Radha Narayanan and I have over 18 years experience as a chemist.  I obtained my PhD in analytical chemistry from Georgia Institute of Technology in 2005.  I worked as an assistant professor of chemistry, patent examiner, and patent agent.  Now, I want to make a career change to go to the software engineering field.  I am currently a Lambda School student in the computer sience major.  I believe taht I would be a good hire especially for companies that are looking for software engineers with chemistry background.

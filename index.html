          <h3>Introduction:</h3>
            <p>If you're travelin' in the north country fair
                Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
                Remember me to one who lives there
                She once was a true love of mine
                If you go when the snowflakes storm
                When the rivers freeze and summer ends
                Please see if she's wearing a coat so warm
                To keep her from the howlin' winds
                Please see for me if her hair hangs long
                If it rolls and flows all down her breast
                Please see for me if her hair hangs long
                For that's the way I remember her best
                I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all
                Many times I've often prayed
                In the darkness of my night
                In the brightness of my day
                So, if you're travelin' in the north country fair
                Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
                Remember me to one who lives there
                She once was a true love of mine</p>
